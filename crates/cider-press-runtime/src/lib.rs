//! Lazy-tensor runtime for `cider-press`.
//!
//! Provides the `Tensor` / graph / `eval()` layer on top of
//! [`cider_press_kernels`]. The runtime owns the buffer pool, the
//! command-buffer batching strategy, and the public op API. Kernel
//! dispatch is delegated downward to `cider-press-kernels`; model
//! architectures are layered upward in `cider-press-models`.
//!
//! Status: scaffolded only. The next step (per `CLAUDE.md`) is to
//! design the lazy-tensor + `eval()` semantics and the buffer pool,
//! using MLX's `array` and `allocator.cpp` as references.
